# Test_4x7-SegDisp
AVR (Attiny2313A) 4x7-Segment Display testing

This project is meant to test the Attiny2313A as a 4 x 7-Segment display driver with direct connect of a common anode display module to the MCU.

The IDE used is Eclipse Oxygen with "AVR Eclipse Plugin" installed.
As a programmer I use a chinese USBasp device.
I have added support for the t2313a to avrdude (see the avrdude.conf file).
